AUTHENTICATE SECKEY:300:TEST/ADMIN
password

In order to authenticate, a user needs to have a handle identity. A handle identity is either a public
key or secret key stored on a handle record. This identity is expressed as a string defining the index of
the value that contains the key separated from the handle by a colon. For example if you had a public
key stored at index 300 on handle 12345/abc the authentication identity would be "300:12345/abc".
When you register a prefix a prefix handle is created on the root service and your public key is stored
on that handle at index 300. As such it is typical for handle users to have a handle identity of the form:
